# Web-Based Light Scheduler (IoT Simulation)

A lightweight IoT dashboard to schedule light ON/OFF times via a web interface, using WebSockets and MQTT to simulate a smart home device. This project demonstrates real-time communication between a web client, a WebSocket server, an MQTT broker, and a microcontroller (Arduino UNO).

## üìå Overview

This system allows a user to schedule when a light turns ON or OFF through a browser interface. The schedule is sent over WebSockets to a Python server, which publishes it to an MQTT topic. A Python subscriber script listens for MQTT messages and sends corresponding commands (`'1'` for ON, `'0'` for OFF) to an Arduino via serial communication. The Arduino then controls a relay to switch the light.
